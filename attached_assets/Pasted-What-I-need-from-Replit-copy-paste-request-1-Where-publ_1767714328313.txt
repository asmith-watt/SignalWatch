What I need from Replit (copy/paste request)
1️⃣ Where publishing is implemented (files + functions)

Ask Replit:

“List the exact files and functions that handle publishing to the Baking & Milling Next.js CMS. Include route handlers and helper modules.”

I’m looking for:

The backend route name (example: /api/publish/baking-milling)

The function that actually does the fetch() / HTTP call

Any shared publisher/adapters

This tells us whether you already have a single, clean publish adapter or multiple ad-hoc ones.

2️⃣ The exact payload sent to the CMS (this is critical)

Ask Replit to paste:

“The exact JSON payload we POST to the Next.js CMS when publishing, with field names.”

I need to see:

externalId (or equivalent)

title

body format (HTML vs Markdown)

tags/categories

source attribution

any metadata

This answers:

Are we idempotent?

Are we sending fields the CMS ignores?

Are we missing SEO or attribution fields?

3️⃣ The CMS response we store

Ask Replit:

“What does the CMS return on publish, and which fields do we persist in the articles table?”

Specifically:

Do we store externalUrl?

Do we store a CMS post ID?

Do we overwrite on re-publish or create a new row?

This tells us if you’ll be able to:

link back to live articles

update instead of duplicate

audit what was published

4️⃣ How duplicates are prevented today

Ask Replit:

“Explain how we prevent publishing the same signal twice to Baking & Milling.”

Possible answers:

externalId upsert

manual UI check

articles table constraint

or nothing (this is common)

If the answer is “nothing,” that’s the one thing you still need.

5️⃣ Where the publish button is wired in the UI

Ask Replit:

“Show where the Baking & Milling publish button calls the backend and what data it sends.”

I need to confirm:

Does it send signalId?

Does it send articleId?

Does it regenerate content on publish (bad) or reuse generated content (good)?

6️⃣ One real example (this seals it)

Ask Replit for one real publish example:

“Paste one example of:

the SignalWatch publish request payload

the CMS response

the resulting row in the articles table”
