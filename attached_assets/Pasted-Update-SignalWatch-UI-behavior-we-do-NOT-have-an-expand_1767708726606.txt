Update SignalWatch UI behavior: we do NOT have an expanded card view in lists. Instead, the right-side “Signal Details” panel is the editorial view. Implement the two-mode design as:
- Compact mode in list cards only
- Editorial mode content inside the Signal Details panel

1) List card updates (compact mode)
In the signal list cards (Signal Graph list and any other lists):
- Keep the current compact card layout.
- Add these elements if missing:
  A) Badge row (max 5):
    - type (secondary)
    - priority (default for high, secondary for medium, outline for low)
    - sentiment ONLY if negative (destructive)
    - contentStatus (outline)
    - aiAnalysis.recommendedFormat if present (secondary; ignore as outline)
  B) Entity chips row (2–4 max) below badges:
    - always include subject company
    - then up to 2 locations from signals.entities.locations
    - then one extra company from signals.entities.companies that is not the subject

Do NOT attempt “expand” in the list card.

2) Signal Details panel becomes the editorial view
In the right-side panel (Signal Details):
- Add a new collapsible section titled “Editorial Insights” (collapsed by default is OK, or expanded if you prefer).
- Render from aiAnalysis if present:
  - Key Takeaways (bullets)
  - Industry Impact (paragraph)
  - Story Angles (bullets)
  - Suggested Follow-up (bullets)
- Show entity chips here too (same chips as list, but can show up to 6 in details).

3) Related Signals panel empty state copy
Replace:
- “No related signals found”
With:
- “No related signals yet. Connections appear as more coverage accumulates.”

4) Related Signals item rendering (when present)
For each related signal returned by /api/signals/:id/related:
- Show title, company, date
- Add “Related via: X, Y” using sharedEntitiesPreview if the API provides it.

Acceptance criteria
- List cards remain compact and skimmable.
- Editorial Insights appears in Signal Details panel.
- No attempt to expand cards in the list.
- UI uses Shadcn components and variants, no hard-coded colors.
