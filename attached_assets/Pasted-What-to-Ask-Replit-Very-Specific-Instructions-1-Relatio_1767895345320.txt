What to Ask Replit (Very Specific Instructions)
1. Relationship Persistence (Industry Map Foundation)

Ask this exactly:

Can we persist company-to-company relationships as first-class records instead of inferring them only at render time?

Required details to include:

New relationships table or collection with:

company_a_id

company_b_id

relationship_type (partner, supplier, competitor, customer, investor, acquirer)

source_signal_id

confidence_score (0–1 or 0–100)

first_seen_at

last_seen_at

Relationships should be upserted, not duplicated

Support multiple relationships between the same companies over time

Why:
This enables relationship trends, “new partnerships,” and delta-based Industry Maps.

2. Theme Extraction on Signals (Trend Intelligence)

Ask this exactly:

Can we add AI-generated “themes” to each signal so signals can be grouped into higher-level concepts like hiring pressure, capacity expansion, or regulatory risk?

Required details:

Add themes[] field to signals

Themes generated via AI at ingestion or analysis time

Allow multiple themes per signal

Themes must be:

Short

Normalized

Reusable across signals

Ability to backfill themes on existing signals

Why:
Signal types are too coarse. Themes are how trends are built.

3. Rolling Metrics Storage (Trend Baselines)

Ask this exactly:

Can we persist rolling signal metrics instead of calculating them on the fly so we can track change over time?

Required details:

Store rolling counts per:

Industry

Signal type

Theme

Time windows:

7-day

30-day

Previous 30-day

Persist snapshots daily or weekly

Store deltas (e.g., +42%)

Why:
You can’t say “activity is up” without a stored baseline.

4. Trend Object (New Intelligence Layer)

Ask this exactly:

Can we introduce a new “Trend” entity that summarizes aggregated signal movement and can be reused across dashboards, digests, and reports?

Required details:

Trend fields:

scope_type (industry, company, region)

scope_id

signal_types[]

themes[]

time_window

direction (up/down/flat)

magnitude

confidence

explanation

generated_at

Trends generated on a schedule (weekly minimum)

Trends stored, not generated ad hoc

Why:
This is the core “intelligence” object you sell.

5. Company Intelligence Snapshot (Non-Article Output)

Ask this exactly:

Can we generate and store an auto-updating company intelligence snapshot that summarizes what changed for each company over a time window?

Required details:

Snapshot includes:

Key changes (bulleted)

Recent signals grouped by theme

Relationship changes

Risks & opportunities summary

Generated weekly or on demand

Stored with timestamp

Viewable in the company profile

Why:
This is the fastest monetizable output.

6. Industry Map Delta Mode (UX Instruction)

Ask this exactly:

Can we add a “Delta Mode” to the Industry Map that highlights only new or changed relationships in a selected time window?

Required details:

Filter by:

Relationship type

Time window

Confidence threshold

Default to recent changes, not full graph

Visually distinguish new vs existing edges

Why:
Static maps are noise. Change is insight.

7. Explicit Non-Goals (Important to Include)

Tell them clearly:

We are not asking for:

Real-time streaming

New external data sources

ML model training

A full UI redesign

Why:
This keeps scope tight and execution fast.
