This task applies to SignalWatch ONLY (editorial platform).
Do NOT modify the public site or ad logic.

GOAL
Ensure articles generated in SignalWatch map cleanly and consistently to structured editorial sections so they render predictably on the public Baking & Milling site.

--------------------------------------------------
1) Article JSON structure (NO schema changes)
--------------------------------------------------
Continue generating articles in these two formats ONLY:

Standard Article (news / analysis / brief)
Signal-First Article (enhanced)

Do NOT change field names or add new required fields.

--------------------------------------------------
2) Field usage guarantees
--------------------------------------------------
Ensure that when generating articles:

Standard Article:
- headline is always present
- subheadline is always present
- body is paragraph-separated with double newlines
- keyTakeaways always has 3–5 items
- seoDescription is 150–160 characters
- suggestedTags has 5–10 items
- sourceAttribution always includes source name + URL

Signal-First Article:
- headline always present
- subheadline always present
- whyItMatters present when business impact exists
- body 3–6 paragraphs
- keyDetails has 3–8 concrete facts
- whatsNext present when forward-looking context exists
- keyTakeaways always present
- seoDescription always present
- suggestedTags always present

--------------------------------------------------
3) Content quality guardrails
--------------------------------------------------
- Headlines: factual, no clickbait, company name when relevant
- Subheadline: clearly explain what changed and who is affected
- Why it matters: business impact, not restatement
- Key details: confirmed facts only (no speculation)
- What’s next: reasonable next steps or implications

--------------------------------------------------
4) Tag consistency
--------------------------------------------------
- Use canonical entity names for suggestedTags
- Avoid near-duplicate tags (e.g., “AI” and “Artificial Intelligence”)
- Prefer industry-standard phrasing

--------------------------------------------------
5) Source attribution
--------------------------------------------------
- Always include a sourceAttribution string
- Source URL must be preserved exactly as provided by the signal

--------------------------------------------------
Acceptance criteria
--------------------------------------------------
- All generated articles conform to the JSON formats above
- No empty or placeholder sections
- Output is deterministic and render-safe
