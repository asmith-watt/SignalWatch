Yes — please implement the date quality improvements. This is a blocking data-quality issue because it inflates “recent” activity and creates false trends.

Required changes (in order):

Do NOT default publishedAt to gatheredAt

If a verified publish date cannot be extracted, set publishedAt = null

Add a status/flag on the signal: needs_date_review = true

Keep gatheredAt as the ingestion timestamp (separate from publishedAt)

Run date verification during ingestion

Call the existing date-verifier module for every new signal

Date verifier should attempt, in priority order:
a) article metadata (schema.org / OpenGraph / meta tags)
b) source feed timestamp (if RSS)
c) parsed date from page content (as last resort)

Store a “date_source” field (metadata/rss/content/manual/unknown) and “date_confidence” (0–100)

Freshness guardrails

Add a configurable freshness window, default 60 days:

Signals older than 60 days should not appear in Recent Scans, metrics, or trends by default

They can be accessible via a “Historical” filter or label (historical=true)

If publishedAt is null (needs_date_review), exclude from trends/metrics until corrected OR bucket into an “unknown_date” group (your call—recommend exclude)

Cleanup / backfill existing bad data

Create an admin backfill job:

Re-run date verifier for existing signals where publishedAt ~= gatheredAt OR publishedAt is suspicious

Fix publishedAt when confidence is high

If still unknown, set needs_date_review=true and keep publishedAt null

Start with affected companies (e.g., 2 Sisters) then expand.

Definition of done:

No old articles should surface as “new” due to fallback dates

Trends/metrics stop spiking from timestamp artifacts

We can audit dates via date_source/date_confidence and needs_date_review

Next steps after the fix (so it’s measurable)

Add a dashboard counter: “Signals with unknown publish date” (needs_date_review)

Track weekly KPI: % signals with verified publishedAt (goal: >95%)

Add a quick UI filter: “Unknown date” so an editor can spot-check and correct a few edge cases.
