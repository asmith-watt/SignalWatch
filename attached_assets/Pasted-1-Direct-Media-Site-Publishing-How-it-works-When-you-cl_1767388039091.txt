1. Direct Media Site Publishing
How it works: When you click "Publish" on a signal, the app:

Generates an AI article from the signal
Selects a stock image based on company industry
POSTs the full payload to an external media website
Environment Variables Needed:

MEDIA_SITE_URL=https://your-media-site.replit.app
MEDIA_SITE_API_KEY=optional-secret-key
API Endpoint:

POST /api/signals/:id/publish-to-media
Payload Sent to Media Site:

{
  "headline": "Article title",
  "subheadline": "Article subtitle",
  "body": "Full article text with source attribution",
  "keyTakeaways": ["point 1", "point 2", "point 3"],
  "seoDescription": "150-160 char meta description",
  "tags": ["M&A", "expansion"],
  "author": "Your Publication Staff",
  "imageUrl": "https://your-app.replit.app/stock-images/image.jpg",
  "signal": {
    "id": 123,
    "type": "acquisition",
    "relevanceScore": 85,
    "sourceName": "Reuters",
    "sourceUrl": "https://..."
  },
  "company": {
    "id": 456,
    "name": "Company Name",
    "industry": "Poultry"
  },
  "generatedAt": "2025-01-02T..."
}
Media Site Receiver Endpoint:
The receiving site needs:

POST /api/articles/receive
Headers: 
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Source: b2b-intelligence-platform
  X-API-Key: (optional)
2. Stock Image Selection
How it works: Images are pre-stored and selected based on company industry using deterministic rotation (signal ID modulo number of images).

Setup:

Create folder: public/stock-images/
Add 3+ images per industry category
Map industries to image filenames
Code Pattern:

const stockImages: Record<string, string[]> = {
  "Poultry": [
    "poultry_chicken_farm_001.jpg",
    "poultry_chicken_farm_002.jpg",
    "poultry_eggs_production_001.jpg",
  ],
  "Feed": [
    "animal_feed_livestock_001.jpg",
    "animal_feed_livestock_002.jpg",
  ],
  "Pet Food": [
    "pet_food_dog_cat_001.jpg",
    "pet_food_dog_cat_002.jpg",
  ],
};
// Select image deterministically
const industry = company?.industry || "Poultry";
const images = stockImages[industry] || stockImages["Poultry"];
const selectedImage = images[signal.id % images.length];
const imageUrl = `${baseUrl}/stock-images/${selectedImage}`;
Image Serving: Express serves static files:

app.use("/stock-images", express.static("public/stock-images"));
Want me to export these as files you can copy to your other app?
